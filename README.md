# Exam - Web Development and API Design

## Extras 
* I have added some CSS in the react components, using "CSS-in-JS"-style, as described [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style). This is done in the [layout-folder](./src/frontend/layout/)

## General notes
* notes about copying from course repo 
  * Some files are completely copied. Others are copied, and later modified. This is differentiated in the comment. 
  * JSON-format does not support comments. `package.json`is copied from [this file](https://github.com/arcuri82/web_development_and_api_design/blob/master/exercise-solutions/quiz-game/part-10/package.json)
* dependencies not used in course 
  * [load-json-file](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-json-file)
  * [write-json-file](https://github.com/sindresorhus/write-json-file)
* on general style 
  * I could have written some functional components. In particular, the components not having state. However, I stuck with class based components for the sake of consistency.
